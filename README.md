## Introduction
This is a sample portfolio page with fully responsive layouts as well as responsive images. Although as per the Udacity project requirement, the porfolio project is finished, however I intend to improve a lot upon this at later time, starting with adding more contents and appropriate links as well as some animations. Hence consider this as work in progress.

Below are some screenshots that show the responsiveness:
